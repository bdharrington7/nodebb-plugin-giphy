# Insert Gifs right from the composer

This NodeBB plugin allows posters to search for an insert gifs from Giphy right in the composer.

It works just like mentions, except you use an ampersand (`&`) and start typing a word or phrase that you want to search for.
Click on one, and the image is automatically embedded into the post.

If you start running into rate limits, i.e. you're a high-traffic forum and some requests aren't completing, you may need to [get your own API key](https://api.giphy.com/submit).

## Installation

Search for "giphy" in the Nodebb Plugins list, or

    npm install nodebb-plugin-giphy
